# DataFetchX
This GitHub project demonstrates a simple data fetching workflow for Telangana government data. Using Python libraries such as requests, pandas, and urllib3, the project fetches data from the Telangana government's data portal (https://data.telangana.gov.in/) through API calls. The fetched data is then stored in CSV files using the pandas library.
